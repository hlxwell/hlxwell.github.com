Recently, in my company project's Airbrake, found a lot of MissingTemplate errors, due to many requests didn't have "content-type", but a list of "http_accept", like, "text/*", actually we do have the "text/html", why it doesn't go to render it. Then I spend couple of days to look into Rails source code to find out the reason.

In Rails, if you not explicitly write "render" method at the end of a Action, it will invoke a "default_render" method, which at <strong>action_controller/metal/implicit_render.rb</strong>, it first call "send_action" if after action method been executed still no "response_body", then it will run default_render.

The render method is located at <strong>action_controller/metal/rendering.rb</strong>, although it has a method call chain, which super is at <strong>abstract_controller/rendering.rb.</strong> This render method will go to "AbstractRenderer#render", then finally "Template#render". but before the "Template#render", the Renderer will go to  "LookupContext#find_template" to find available template according to context. <strong>LookupContext#find_all, #find</strong> is the method find template, but it is using @view_paths.find_all, which is a<strong> ActionView::PathSet </strong>object.

ActionView::PathSet#find_all, finally use <strong>FileSystemResolver#find_all</strong> to find file template. I looked into the code and debugged a little bit found the finally template finding behavior is <strong>Dir['"YOU_PROJECT/app/views/home/feedback{.en,.en,}{.json,}{.rhtml,.rjs,.builder,.rxml,.erb,}"']</strong>, it's actually is home/feedback{locale}{formats}{handler}, you can only change locale and formats by request header.

So what's the  problem of MissingTemplate? because text/* wasn't been convert to text/json, text/html ... , but it is fixed in Rails edge. (4.0.0.beta)
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">#mime_negotiation.rb
def parse_data_with_trailing_star(input)
Mime::SET.select { |m| m =~ input }
end</p>
so Mime::Type.parse("text/*") will return correct result.

Solution to solve this issue is:
<ol>
	<li>Let Mime::Type.parse *<em>/*</em>, like Mime["text/*"] =&gt; text/html, text/json, text/xml</li>
	<li>Find exist template which match to the mime type list.</li>
	<li>If find the template, render it, or else, raise "MissingTemplate" error.</li>
</ol>
This is my solution for fixing it,  https://gist.github.com/1517007
