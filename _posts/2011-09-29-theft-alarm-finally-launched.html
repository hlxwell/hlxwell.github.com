Recently I lost my old nokia phone then bought a new iphone 4, then I googled a little bit about anti-theft app of iphone, then I found a lot of people lost phone on bus or metro, when they are listening music..., when they realized they lost their iphone, the theft already gone.

So theft-alarm will alarm just when thief unplug the headset(thief won't steal your headset, because it's stupid.).

Vibration + Loud Alarm + Custom alarm sound will alarm at same time.
