<strong>__FILE__</strong> is the name of the current source file.
<strong>$0</strong> at the top level is the name of the top-level program being executed.
<strong>$0 == __FILE__</strong> means if you are running a rb file directly.
You'll often see this used in a library file that usually gets
loaded from another file (so __FILE__ == $0 is false), but can also be
run standalone for the sake of running tests. That's why need to add this condition.
