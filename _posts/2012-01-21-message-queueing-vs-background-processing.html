Just read about this article:

http://www.mikeperham.com/2011/05/04/background-processing-vs-message-queueing/

One important viewpoint in this artile is:Â <strong>message queueing is a superset of background processing</strong>

girl_friday plugin is a backgroud processing gem, that no need install any MQ system. So for system don't need to queue up request, can use this instead of complicated MQ system.
