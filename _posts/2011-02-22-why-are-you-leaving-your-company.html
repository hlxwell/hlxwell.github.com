<div>Why are you leaving your company?</div>
<div>I am always trying to understand why people leaving their job, although they got good salary and in a good company.</div>
<div>Here I collect some reason for people leaving previous company:</div>
<ul>
  <li>I found myself bored with the work and looking for more challenges. I am an excellent employee and I didn't want my unhappiness to have any impact on the job I was doing for my employer.</li>
  <li>There isn't room for growth with my current employer and I'm ready to move on to a new challenge.</li>
  <li>I'm looking for a bigger challenge and to grow my career and I couldn't job hunt part time while working. It didn't seem ethical to use my former employer's time.</li>
  <li>I've decided that is not the direction I want to go in my career and my current employer has no opportunities in the direction I'd like to head.</li>
  <li>After several years in my last position, I'm looking for an company where I can contribute and grow in a team-oriented environment.</li>
  <li>I am interested in a new challenge and an opportunity to use my technical skills and experience in a different capacity than I have in the past.</li>
  <li>I recently received my degree and I want to utilize my educational background in my next position.</li>
  <li>I am interested in a job with more responsibility, and I am very ready for a new challenge.</li>
  <li>I left my last position in order to spend more time with my family. Circumstances have changed and I'm more than ready for full-time employment again.</li>
  <li>I am seeking a position with a stable company with room for growth and opportunity for advancement.</li>
  <li>I was commuting to the city and spending a significant amount of time each day on travel. I would prefer to be closer to home.</li>
  <li>To be honest, I wasn't considering a move, but, I saw this job posting and was intrigued by the position and the company. It sounds like an exciting opportunity and an ideal match with my qualifications.</li>
  <li>This position seemed like an excellent match for my skills and experience and I am not able to fully utilize them in my present job.</li>
  <li>The company was cutting back and, unfortunately, my job was one of those eliminated.</li>
</ul>

Didn't be cared, like he didn't been put at a important position, or just like a dust man in the project.

Didn't feel he is important.

Didn't get the agreement from boss or leader.

Didn't feel they have enough room for growth.

Didn't feel a team belonging feeling.

Didn't increase salary for a long time.
