Personally, I like to focus on doing one thing and make it perfect, so as soon as I been engaged to one thing, 
I will spend all my time and consentration on it. 

Then How to engage one project as soon as possible?

1. Stop doing other projects, or phase out doing them.
2. To know more things related to this project.
3. Clarify the aim and things you need to do, seems like couple of days job could finish them. (that's why we need a sprint, if it's too long, it's frustring.)
4. Make the first success ;)
